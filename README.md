## Overview:

The first set of DOM getters we'll talk about are the `getElement(s)By` methods, like  `getElementById`.

## Instruction:

Create a `getelements.js`and link it your index.html 

Work through the prompts in `getElements.js`

Verify the selected DOM nodes by logging the result in the console. 

## Prompts:

```jsx
/*
 * You Do: Work through the following prompts. Write your code below each
 * comment.
 */

// 1. Get the element with an ID of 'first'

// 2. Now delete that first element (in the html file), and re-run your code.
//    What changed?

// 3. Get the elements with a class of 'second' with getElementsByClassName:

// 4. Delete one of the elements with a class of 'second' and refresh the page.
//    Do you get a similar result?

// 5. Get the span element using getElementsByTagname:

// 6. Add a span anywhere, and re-run the last piece of code. What's different?
```
